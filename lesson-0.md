# Ryan's Simple Guide to Using Git

Hello there! I heard you wanted to learn Git, so I've written up a short guide
for you. This will cover the basics of Git, and some commands that you'll
be using pretty often. Although there are a lot of other commands available,
this guide won't be covering them. We're keeping it simple here, folks!

I'll be running through some basics here, as well as some moderately challenging
concepts.
